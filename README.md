## Requirements

- [matapatos/wp-fastendpoints](https://packagist.org/packages/matapatos/wp-fastendpoints)

## Installation

Add plugin to WordPress and then install all the dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

## Lint

```bash
composer test:lint
```

## Running tests

```bash
composer test             # Runs linter + unit and integration tests
composer test:unit        # Runs unit tests
composer test:integration # Runs integration tests
```

### Setup WordPress

Please note that before running the integration tests you have to specify the WordPress
version you want to use, via:

```bash
composer setup:wp:6.0     # For the latest 6.0.x version
composer setup:wp:6.1     # For the latest 6.1.x version
composer setup:wp:6.2     # For the latest 6.2.x version
composer setup:wp:6.3     # For the latest 6.3.x version
composer setup:wp:6.4     # For the latest 6.4.x version
composer setup:wp:latest  # For the latest x.x.x version
```

### Known errors

#### WordPress 6.5.x requires MySQL 5.5.5 or higher

Since WordPress have bumped the minimum MySQL version from 5.0 to 5.5.5 in WordPress
6.5.x the integration tests might not work for the latest version until
this [PR changes is released](https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-sqlite-db/pull/61).
In other words, `composer setup:wp:latest` might not work so use `composer setup:wp:6.4`
instead.
